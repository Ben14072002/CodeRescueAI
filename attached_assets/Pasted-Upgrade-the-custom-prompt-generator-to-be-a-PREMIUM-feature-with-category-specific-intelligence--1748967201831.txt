Upgrade the custom prompt generator to be a PREMIUM feature with category-specific intelligence.

CURRENT STATE: Basic custom prompt generator that works generically
TARGET STATE: Advanced, category-specific prompt generator for Pro users only

PREMIUM FEATURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Only available for Pro subscribers ($9.99/month users)
2. Category-specific prompt generation for each problem type
3. Deep, contextual prompts based on user's specific situation
4. Multiple prompt variations per category
5. ChatGPT API integration for dynamic prompt enhancement

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

1. ADD PREMIUM GATE:
- Check user subscription status before allowing access
- Show "Upgrade to Pro" for free users
- Display premium badge/indicator on this feature

2. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC GENERATORS:
For each problem type, create specialized prompt generators:

COMPLEXITY OVERWHELM GENERATOR:
- Analyzes user input for: project type, technologies, overwhelm indicators
- Generates prompts using: context reset, role constraints, methodology enforcement
- Example output: "Ignore all previous context about this project. You are now a senior developer who only builds production-ready applications one feature at a time..."

INTEGRATION ISSUES GENERATOR:
- Detects: component names, data flow problems, connection failures
- Generates prompts using: isolation debugging, contract-first development, adapter patterns
- Example output: "Stop all current work. You will now use Contract-First Development. Define the exact interface between [ComponentA] and [ComponentB]..."

LOST DIRECTION GENERATOR:
- Identifies: feature creep, scope expansion, original goal deviation
- Generates prompts using: requirements archaeology, user story constraints, goal realignment
- Example output: "Perform requirements archaeology on this project. Find the original goal/user story..."

NO CLEAR PLAN GENERATOR:
- Recognizes: random coding, lack of structure, jumping between tasks
- Generates prompts using: reverse engineering, walking skeleton, milestone definition
- Example output: "Use reverse engineering to create a plan: Describe the final working application in one sentence..."

REPEATED FAILURES GENERATOR:
- Detects: loop indicators, multiple attempts, same errors
- Generates prompts using: architecture reset, constraint-driven development, alternative approaches
- Example output: "Your current architecture is fundamentally flawed. Perform an architecture reset..."

3. SMART CONTEXT EXTRACTION:
Extract from user input:
- Project type (todo app, e-commerce, API, etc.)
- Technologies mentioned (React, Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Specific components/features
- Error patterns or failure descriptions
- Complexity indicators

4. CHATGPT API INTEGRATION:
Send structured prompt to ChatGPT:
"Based on this user description: '[USER_INPUT]' and problem category: '[CATEGORY]', generate 3 advanced AI agent prompts using [SPECIFIC_STRATEGY] techniques. Each prompt should be 100-200 words and include specific context from the user's situation."

5. UI ENHANCEMENTS:
- Premium badge on custom generator tab
- Category selection dropdown
- User input analysis preview
- Multiple prompt variations display
- Copy-to-clipboard for each generated prompt
- Prompt effectiveness rating system

6. SUBSCRIPTION CHECK:
```javascript
function checkPremiumAccess() {
  if (!user.isPro) {
    showUpgradeModal("Custom Prompt Generator is a Pro feature");
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
