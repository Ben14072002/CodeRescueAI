üëã Hi! I'm your AI Development Wizard. I'm here to help you get unstuck on any coding problem you're facing with AI tools like Cursor, Replit, Claude, or any other development challenge.

I'm designed to provide deep analysis and create copy-paste ready prompts that use advanced prompting strategies. I'll analyze your problem thoroughly, ask targeted questions, and generate intelligent solutions with specific, actionable AI prompts.

What coding challenge has you stuck today?
12:55:52
i am creating a qr code generator - the system should generate a ar code for every partner added, my ai agent gets stuck here and the qr codes lead to a 404
12:56:37
I understand you're dealing with a coding challenge. Let me analyze this and ask a few targeted questions to give you the most effective solution.

Analyzing your problem...
12:56:38
Got it! I can see this is a medium QR code generation and URL handling issue. Let me ask you a few quick questions to nail down the exact solution:

**Question 1:** Can you verify if the URLs being generated by the AI agent are correctly formatted and match the expected pattern for your web server routing?
12:56:44
yes i already verified
12:57:02
Perfect! **Question 2:** Have you checked the database entries to ensure that the URLs being generated have corresponding records in the database, and that these records are correctly linked to existing web pages?
12:57:04
yes!
12:57:14
Perfect! **Question 3:** Can you check if the QR code generation process includes any steps that might be altering or truncating the URLs before they are encoded into the QR code?
12:57:17
there are no such steps
12:57:41
Excellent! I have all the information I need. Let me create your personalized action plan...
