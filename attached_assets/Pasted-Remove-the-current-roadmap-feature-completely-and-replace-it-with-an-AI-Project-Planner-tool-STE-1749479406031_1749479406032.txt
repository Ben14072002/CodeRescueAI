Remove the current roadmap feature completely and replace it with an AI Project Planner tool.

STEP 1: REMOVE ROADMAP FEATURE
- Delete all roadmap-related code and files
- Remove roadmap navigation items
- Remove roadmap database schemas
- Clean up any roadmap references in the codebase

STEP 2: BUILD AI PROJECT PLANNER REPLACEMENT
Create a new "Project Planner" feature in the same location where roadmap was.

FEATURE OVERVIEW: Interactive brainstorming tool that helps users create detailed project specifications through AI conversation.

NEW FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION:

1. CREATE PROJECT PLANNER PAGE
Route: /project-planner (replace old roadmap route)
Navigation: "Project Planner" (Pro feature)
Access: Pro users only (same as roadmap was)

2. PROJECT INPUT FORM
Simple starting form:
- Project Name (text input)
- Project Description (textarea, 200+ characters)
- Experience Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- [Start Planning Session] button

3. INTERACTIVE BRAINSTORMING INTERFACE
Two-panel layout:
- LEFT PANEL: Chat interface for AI conversation
- RIGHT PANEL: Live project plan document building

Chat Interface Features:
- AI asks intelligent follow-up questions
- User responds to flesh out project details
- Smart question generation based on project type
- Conversation flows naturally to gather all needed info

4. AI CONVERSATION LOGIC
AI should ask questions like:
- "Who will use this application?"
- "What's the main problem this solves?"
- "What are the 3 most important features?"
- "Do you need user authentication?"
- "Will this be web-only or mobile responsive?"
- "Any third-party integrations needed?"

Questions should adapt based on user's previous answers.

5. LIVE PROJECT PLAN GENERATION
As user answers questions, build project plan in real-time:

PROJECT PLAN SECTIONS:
- Project Overview (purpose, goals, target users)
- Feature Specifications (essential vs nice-to-have)
- Technical Recommendations (tech stack, architecture)
- User Experience Design (user flows, interface needs)
- Development Timeline (phases, estimates)
- Potential Challenges (risks, solutions)

6. PLAN EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY
- Download as PDF button
- Download as Markdown button  
- Save to user account
- "My Project Plans" section in dashboard

7. PLAN REFINEMENT
Allow users to:
- Edit any section of the generated plan
- Ask follow-up questions to AI
- Regenerate specific sections
- Continue brainstorming session

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use existing UI components and styling
- Chat interface with message bubbles
- Real-time plan updates as conversation progresses
- Clean, professional document formatting
- Mobile-responsive design
- Integration with existing Pro user system

CONVERSATION FLOW EXAMPLE:
AI: "Let's plan your project! You mentioned building [project name]. Who is the main user of this app?"
User: "Small business owners who need to track inventory"
AI: "Great! What's the biggest inventory problem they face right now?"
[Plan updates with "Target Users: Small business owners" and "Problem: Inventory tracking"]

BUILD PRIORITY:
1. Basic input form and navigation
2. Chat interface functionality  
3. AI question generation logic
4. Live plan building
5. Export/save functionality
6. Plan editing capabilities

REPLACE THE ROADMAP FEATURE COMPLETELY - this becomes the new flagship Pro feature that helps users plan projects before building them.

Keep the same Pro access gates and pricing, just swap the functionality.
