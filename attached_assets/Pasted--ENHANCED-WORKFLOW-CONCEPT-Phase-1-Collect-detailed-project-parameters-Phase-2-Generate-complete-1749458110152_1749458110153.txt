SOPHISTICATED PROMPTS FOR EACH STEP
STEP 2.2: Build Registration Endpoint

🤖 AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"You are a senior Node.js developer working on user registration for a todo app with team collaboration features.

CONTEXT: You have an Express server running with MongoDB connected. Users will register with email/password and join teams later.

TASK: Create ONLY the user registration endpoint (/api/auth/register).

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Validate email format and password strength (min 8 chars, 1 number)
2. Check if email already exists
3. Hash password with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
4. Save user to database with: email, hashedPassword, createdAt, teams: []
5. Return success message (NO JWT yet - that's next step)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT implement login functionality
- Do NOT create JWT tokens yet  
- Do NOT build team functionality
- Use only: express, mongoose, bcrypt
- Create in /routes/auth.js file

VALIDATION:
Test with Postman: POST /api/auth/register
Body: {"email": "test@test.com", "password": "password123"}
Expected: User saved in database with hashed password

Start coding the registration endpoint now."
🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT
Implement the enhanced CodeBreaker Roadmap Creator with complete project recipe generation.

NEW WORKFLOW TO BUILD:

1. PROJECT RECIPE GENERATOR:
After user completes detailed project form, generate comprehensive project plan:

Features to implement:
- Complete architecture overview
- Detailed file structure
- Database schemas
- API endpoint specifications  
- UI component breakdown
- Dependency lists
- Deployment strategy
- Timeline estimates

Output format: 
- Readable markdown document
- Downloadable as PDF or .md file
- Professional formatting with sections
- Technical specifications included

2. PLAN BREAKDOWN ENGINE:
Take the complete recipe and break into logical phases:

Phase structure:
- Major phases (Setup, Auth, Core Features, etc.)
- Sub-steps within each phase
- Time estimates for each step
- Dependencies between steps
- Logical progression order

3. SOPHISTICATED PROMPT GENERATION:
For each step, create detailed AI prompts that include:

Prompt components:
- Role setting ("You are a senior X developer")
- Full context (what's been built so far)
- Specific task (exactly what to build now)
- Technical requirements and constraints
- What NOT to build (prevent scope creep)
- Validation steps (how to test)
- File locations and naming

4. DOWNLOAD FUNCTIONALITY:
- "Download Complete Recipe" button
- Generates PDF/Markdown of full project plan
- Includes all phases, steps, and technical specs
- Professional formatting for reference

5. ENHANCED UI:
Three-panel layout:
- LEFT: Phase overview with progress
- CENTER: Current step details with AI prompt
- RIGHT: Complete recipe download + rescue

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Recipe Generation Logic:
```javascript
function generateProjectRecipe(projectDetails) {
  return {
    overview: generateArchitectureOverview(projectDetails),
    fileStructure: generateFileStructure(projectDetails),
    database: generateDatabaseSchema(projectDetails),
    api: generateAPISpecs(projectDetails),
    components: generateUIComponents(projectDetails),
    dependencies: generateDependencyList(projectDetails),
    deployment: generateDeploymentPlan(projectDetails),
    timeline: generateDetailedTimeline(projectDetails)
  };
}
Step Breakdown Logic:
javascriptfunction breakdownIntoSteps(projectRecipe) {
  const phases = identifyMajorPhases(projectRecipe);
  return phases.map(phase => ({
    phaseName: phase.name,
    timeEstimate: phase.duration,
    steps: generatePhaseSteps(phase, projectRecipe)
  }));
}
Prompt Generation:
javascriptfunction generateStepPrompt(step, projectContext, completedSteps) {
  return {
    roleContext: generateRoleContext(step.type),
    projectContext: generateProjectContext(projectContext),
    currentTask: generateTaskDescription(step),
    constraints: generateConstraints(step, projectContext),
    validation: generateValidationSteps(step),
    fileSpecs: generateFileSpecifications(step)
  };
}
PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:

Recipe generation engine (most important)
Step breakdown logic
Download functionality
Enhanced prompt generation
UI improvements

This transforms CodeBreaker into a complete project planning + execution tool!
