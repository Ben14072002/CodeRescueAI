**UI Redesign Prompt for Codebreaker Platform**

Transform the current Codebreaker interface to match the modern, sleek design aesthetic shown in the reference image. Focus ONLY on visual design changes - do not modify functionality, features, or core content.

**Overall Design Direction:**

- Implement a dark theme with deep purple/violet gradients as the primary background
- Use a cosmic/space-inspired aesthetic with subtle particle effects or starfield background
- Apply modern glassmorphism effects with semi-transparent elements
- Maintain clean, minimalist layout with generous white space

**Color Palette:**

- Primary background: Deep purple to black gradient (`#1a0b2e` to `#0f0419`)
- Secondary: Purple/violet accents (`#6366f1`, `#8b5cf6`)
- Text: White/light gray (`#ffffff`, `#e5e7eb`)
- Accent colors: Bright purple/pink for CTAs (`#a855f7`, `#ec4899`)
- Cards/containers: Semi-transparent dark with subtle borders

**Typography:**

- Use modern, clean sans-serif fonts (similar to Inter or Poppins)
- Implement proper font hierarchy with varied weights
- Ensure excellent readability on dark backgrounds

**Layout & Components:**

**Hero Section:**

- Large, bold headline with gradient text effect
- Subtitle in lighter weight
- Prominent CTA button with gradient background and hover effects

**Feature Cards:**

**Pricing Section:**

- Apply dark card design with purple accents
- Highlight the middle tier with special styling
- Use modern pricing typography

**Interactive Elements:**

- Buttons: Rounded corners, gradient backgrounds, hover animations
- Form fields: Dark backgrounds with purple focus states
- Add subtle micro-animations throughout

**Technical Implementation Notes:**

- Keep all existing HTML structure and classes
- Focus changes on CSS styling only
- Ensure responsive design is maintained
- Add CSS animations and transitions for smooth interactions
- Use CSS gradients, backdrop-filter, and box-shadow for effects

**Specific Elements to Update:**

1. Replace current color scheme with dark purple theme
2. Add gradient overlays to backgrounds
3. Implement glassmorphism on all card elements
4. Update button styles with modern gradients
5. Add subtle animations and hover effects

Transform the interface to look premium, modern, and cutting-edge while maintaining all existing functionality and content. The result should feel like a high-end SaaS product that developers would trust and want to use.
