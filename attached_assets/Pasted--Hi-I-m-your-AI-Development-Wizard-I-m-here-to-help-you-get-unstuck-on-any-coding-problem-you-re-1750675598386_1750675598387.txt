I understand you're dealing with a coding challenge. Let me analyze this and ask a few targeted questions to give you the most effective solution.

Analyzing your problem...
12:43:27
Got it! I can see this is a medium general issue. Let me ask you a few quick questions to nail down the exact solution:

**Question 1:** What specific error message or behavior are you seeing?
12:43:28
when scanning the qr code i get to a 404 page
12:43:55
Perfect! **Question 2:** What did you expect to happen instead?
12:43:56
every qr code generated should be corresponding to a partner and should lead to their website
12:44:26
Perfect! **Question 3:** What was the last thing you tried before getting stuck?
12:44:27
changing the urls
