USER JOURNEY MAP:

STEP 1: LANDING PAGE
User arrives → Sees "Start 3-Day Pro Trial" CTA → Clicks button

STEP 2: SIGNUP CHOICE
Show signup page with TWO clear options:
[ ] "Start 3-Day Pro Trial" (Recommended)
    - Full access to all Pro features
    - Requires payment method (no charge during trial)
    - Automatic billing after 3 days unless cancelled
    
[ ] "Use Free Plan"  
    - 1 rescue per month
    - Basic features only
    - No payment required

STEP 3A: TRIAL SIGNUP FLOW
If user chooses trial:
1. Collect email + password
2. Collect Stripe payment info (no charge yet)
3. Set user.trialStartDate = NOW
4. Set user.trialEndDate = NOW + 3 days
5. Set user.status = "trial_active"
6. Redirect to dashboard with "Trial Active" banner

STEP 3B: FREE SIGNUP FLOW  
If user chooses free:
1. Collect email + password only
2. Set user.status = "free"
3. Set user.monthlyRescuesUsed = 0
4. Redirect to dashboard with free limitations

STEP 4: TRIAL EXPERIENCE
Trial user dashboard shows:
- "Trial Active: 2 days remaining" countdown
- Full access to custom prompt generator
- Unlimited rescues
- All Pro features unlocked
- NO "Upgrade to Pro" buttons

STEP 5: TRIAL EXPIRY
After 3 days:
- Auto-charge the payment method → user becomes Pro
- OR if payment fails → revert to free plan (1 rescue/month)
- Show appropriate success/failure message

FEATURE ACCESS LOGIC:
```javascript
function getUserAccess(user) {
  if (user.isPro) {
    return "full_access";
  }
  if (user.status === "trial_active" && !isTrialExpired(user)) {
    return "full_access"; // Same as Pro during trial
  }
  return "free_access"; // Limited features
}
UI STATES TO IMPLEMENT:

Trial Active: Show countdown, full features, no upgrade prompts
Trial Expired → Paid: Show Pro dashboard
Trial Expired → Failed Payment: Show free limitations + upgrade option
Free User: Show usage limits + upgrade prompts

IMPLEMENT THIS COMPLETE WORKFLOW so users understand exactly what happens at each step.
