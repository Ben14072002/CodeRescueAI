## ðŸš€ SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENT PROMPTS

### **PROMPT 1: Hero Section Animations**
```
Add engaging animations to the CodeBreaker hero section:

HERO ANIMATIONS:
1. Fade-in + slide-up animation for the main headline (staggered by words)
2. Typewriter effect for the subheadline 
3. Floating/breathing animation for the CTA button
4. Subtle parallax background effect (geometric shapes moving at different speeds)
5. Smooth fade-in for all other hero elements with 100ms delays between each

CSS REQUIREMENTS:
- Use CSS @keyframes for all animations
- Add loading state with skeleton placeholders
- Ensure animations trigger when page loads
- 0.8s duration for most animations, easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Use intersection observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Add 'animate' class when elements enter viewport
- Provide fallback for reduced-motion preferences

Test the hero animations before proceeding.
```

### **PROMPT 2: Problem Selection Cards with Hover Effects**
```
Make the problem selection cards interactive and engaging:

CARD ANIMATIONS:
1. Smooth scale + shadow animation on hover (scale: 1.05, deeper shadow)
2. Icon animation on hover (rotate, scale, or bounce)
3. Background gradient shift on hover
4. Smooth color transition for text
5. Selected state animation (glow effect, scale, border animation)
6. Staggered entrance animation when cards first load

MICRO-INTERACTIONS:
- Subtle cursor change on hover
- Click animation (quick scale down then up)
- Loading state when card is selected
- Success animation when selection is confirmed

CSS TECHNIQUES:
- Use transform: translateY() and scale() for performance
- Box-shadow transitions for depth
- CSS Grid with smooth transitions
- Will-change property for optimized rendering

Create smooth, professional interactions that feel responsive and premium.
```

### **PROMPT 3: Scroll-Triggered Animations**
```
Add scroll-triggered animations throughout the website:

SCROLL EFFECTS:
1. Fade-in + slide-up for sections as they enter viewport
2. Staggered animations for lists and feature grids
3. Progress indicator for form completion
4. Smooth parallax for background elements
5. Number counters that animate when visible (user counts, success rates)

PARALLAX IMPLEMENTATION:
- Background shapes move at 0.5x scroll speed
- Hero background elements at 0.3x speed
- Subtle parallax for section backgrounds
- Ensure mobile-friendly (disable on small screens if needed)

INTERSECTION OBSERVER SETUP:
```javascript
const observerOptions = {
  threshold: 0.1,
  rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px'
};

// Trigger animations when 10% of element is visible
```

Performance: Use transform3d for hardware acceleration, debounce scroll events.
```

### **PROMPT 4: Navigation and Button Micro-Interactions**
```
Enhance all interactive elements with smooth micro-interactions:

NAVIGATION:
- Smooth slide-in animation for mobile menu
- Hover effects for nav links (underline animation)
- Active state animations
- Smooth color transitions

BUTTONS:
- Hover state: subtle scale + shadow increase
- Click state: quick scale down (0.95) then back
- Loading state with spinner or pulse animation
- Success state with checkmark animation
- Disabled state with opacity transition

CTA BUTTONS:
- Gradient background animation on hover
- Pulsing effect to draw attention
- Smooth icon transitions
- Ripple effect on click (optional)

FORM ELEMENTS:
- Focus state animations for inputs
- Label floating animation
- Validation state transitions (error/success)
- Progress indicators for multi-step forms

Use CSS custom properties for consistent timing and easing across all interactions.
```

### **PROMPT 5: Page Transitions and Loading States**
```
Add smooth page transitions and loading states:

PAGE TRANSITIONS:
- Fade transition between different sections
- Smooth slide animations for multi-step flows
- Loading overlay with brand-consistent spinner
- Skeleton loading for dynamic content

LOADING STATES:
- Button loading states (spinner replaces text)
- Card loading skeletons while content loads
- Progress bars for longer operations
- Smooth state transitions (loading â†’ success â†’ normal)

CONTENT REVEALS:
- Staggered reveal for prompt lists
- Smooth accordion/collapsible sections
- Modal animations (fade + scale)
- Toast notifications with slide-in animation

PERFORMANCE:
- Preload critical animations
- Use CSS containment for animation boundaries
- Optimize for 60fps on mobile devices
- Provide reduced-motion alternatives

Create a cohesive animation system that feels polished and intentional.
```

### **PROMPT 6: Advanced Interactive Features**
```
Add premium interactive features that create "wow" moments:

ADVANCED FEATURES:
1. Prompt preview with live syntax highlighting
2. Interactive demo section (simulated AI conversation)
3. Real-time typing indicators for examples
4. Smooth data visualization animations (if showing stats)
5. Interactive feature comparison table
6. Animated testimonial carousel
7. Parallax case study cards

CUSTOM INTERACTIONS:
- Drag-and-drop for prompt customization
- Interactive prompt builder with live preview
- Smooth filter animations for prompt categories
- Expandable FAQ sections with smooth animations
- Copy-to-clipboard with success animation

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Use RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Lazy load non-critical animations
- Progressive enhancement approach

Focus on creating memorable interactions that showcase the product's value.

## ðŸŽ¨ ANIMATION SYSTEM PROMPT

### **PROMPT 7: Create Consistent Animation System**
```
Create a cohesive animation design system for CodeBreaker:

CSS CUSTOM PROPERTIES:
```css
:root {
  --duration-fast: 0.15s;
  --duration-normal: 0.3s;
  --duration-slow: 0.5s;
  --easing-standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  --easing-enter: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1);
  --easing-exit: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1);
}
```

ANIMATION CLASSES:
- .fade-in, .slide-up, .scale-in
- .stagger-children (for sequential animations)
- .parallax-element
- .hover-lift, .hover-glow
- .loading-skeleton, .loading-spinner

JAVASCRIPT UTILITIES:
- Animation observer for scroll triggers
- Stagger animation helper
- Performance monitoring
- Reduced motion detection

TESTING:
- Test on various devices and browsers
- Ensure animations don't interfere with functionality

```
Optimize all animations for mobile devices:

MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Reduce animation complexity on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interaction areas (44px minimum)
- Faster animation durations for mobile (0.2s vs 0.3s)
- Disable parallax on mobile for better performance
- Optimize for touch interactions vs hover states

PERFORMANCE:
- Use transform and opacity for animations (avoid layout triggers)
- Implement animation budgeting (limit concurrent animations)
- Add will-change property strategically
- Remove animations on low-end devices

TOUCH INTERACTIONS:
- Touch feedback for all interactive elements
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Pull-to-refresh animation (if applicable)
- Swipe gestures for carousels

TEST ON:
- Various mobile devices
- Different network conditions
